# Zettelkasten

## An old method

Pioneered by Conrad Gessner (1516 - 1565). Most well known person to use it : Niklas Luhmann
(1927-1998), 90 000 cards in a physical system.

## Method

Store cards (or Zettel) in a set of boxes. Every card has a unique identifier and is linked
to other cards threw references to one-another.

One card can be about an idea, a theme, a subject and can be long or short. It can also be
a summary.

The system can be physical or numerical (with the help of a [[knowledge-management-software]]).

You search for a subject and then have the ability to jump from one another. We can think
of [Wikipedia](www.wikipedia.com) as a big zettelkaste.
